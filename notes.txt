Update Log (26/06/2024):
* Deleted old work and followed Coder Space's python tutorial on 3D rendering
* ERROR: Cube not shown
Update Log (27/06/2024):
* Fixed w_width and w_height variable arguments being 0, by turning their types and WIDTH and HEIGHT's types to double.
* Fixed to screen matrix by changing two variable assignment in one line to two separate variable assignments.
* EXAMPLE: int x, y = 0, 1; ---> int x = 0; int y = 1;
* ERROR: Cube turns into line? Outside of screen WIDTH and HEIGHT, so viewport was changed.

I may have found the reason why the cube aint showing up.
I think its because the matrix multiplication function uses
multidimensional arrays but all the vertices and camera vectors
are {x, y, z, w} instead of {{x}, {y}, {z}, {w}}
So a major overhaul is needed in those parts
